You do not need to setup the environment if using conda, all dependencies are installed automatically.

 $ conda install --file requirements-conda.txt

Datasets can be dowloaded by using the download.sh script:
 
 $ bash data/download.sh <dataset>
  
Replace <dataset> with corresponding entry from the table. You can also download all of them at once:
  
$ bash data/download.sh
